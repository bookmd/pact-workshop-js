# Pact JS workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

[Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 4 - Verify the provider

We need to make the pact file (the contract) that was produced from the consumer test available to the Provider module. This will help us verify that the provider can meet the requirements as set out in the contract. For now, we'll hard code the path to where it is saved in the consumer test, in step 11 we investigate a better way of doing this.

Now let's make a start on writing Pact tests to validate the consumer contract:

In `provider/product/product.pact.test.js`:

```javascript
const { Verifier } = require("@pact-foundation/pact");
const path = require("path");

// Setup provider server to verify
const app = require("express")();
app.use(require("./product.routes"));
const server = app.listen("8080");

describe("Pact Verification", () => {
  it("validates the expectations of ProductService", () => {
    const opts = {
      logLevel: "INFO",
      providerBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
      provider: "ProductService",
      providerVersion: "1.0.0",
      pactUrls: [
        path.resolve(
          __dirname,
          "../../consumer/pacts/frontendwebsite-productservice.json"
        ),
      ],
    };

    return new Verifier(opts)
      .verifyProvider()
      .then((output) => {
        console.log(output);
      })
      .finally(() => {
        server.close();
      });
  });
});
```

To simplify running the tests, add this to `provider/package.json`:

```javascript
// add it under scripts
"test:pact": "npx jest --testTimeout=30000 --testMatch \"**/*.pact.test.js\""
```

We now need to validate the pact generated by the consumer is valid, by executing it against the running service provider, which should fail:

```console
‚ùØ npm run test:pact --prefix provider

Verifying a pact between FrontendWebsite and ProductService

  get product with ID 10
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (FAILED)
      includes headers
        "Content-Type" with value "application/json; charset=utf-8" (FAILED)
      has a matching body (FAILED)

  get all products
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers
        "Content-Type" with value "application/json; charset=utf-8" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)


Failures:

1) Verifying a pact between FrontendWebsite and ProductService Given product with ID 10 exists - get product with ID 10
    1.1) has a matching body
           expected 'application/json;charset=utf-8' body but was 'text/html;charset=utf-8'
    1.2) has status code 200
           expected 200 but was 404
    1.3) includes header 'Content-Type' with value 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
           Expected header 'Content-Type' to have value 'application/json; charset=utf-8' but was 'text/html; charset=utf-8'
```

![Pact Verification](diagrams/workshop_step4_pact.svg)

The test has failed, as the expected path `/products/{id}` is returning 404. We incorrectly believed our provider was following a RESTful design, but the authors were too lazy to implement a better routing solution ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The correct endpoint which the consumer should call is `/product/{id}`.
