# Pact JS workshop

## Introduction

This workshop is aimed at demonstrating core features and benefits of contract testing with Pact.

Whilst contract testing can be applied retrospectively to systems, we will follow the [consumer driven contracts](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach in this workshop - where a new consumer and provider are created in parallel to evolve a service over time, especially where there is some uncertainty with what is to be built.

This workshop should take from 1 to 2 hours, depending on how deep you want to go into each topic.

**Workshop outline**:

- [step 1: **create consumer**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step1#step-1---simple-consumer-calling-provider): Create our consumer before the Provider API even exists
- [step 2: **unit test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step2#step-2---client-tested-but-integration-fails): Write a unit test for our consumer
- [step 3: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step3#step-3---pact-to-the-rescue): Write a Pact test for our consumer
- [step 4: **pact verification**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step4#step-4---verify-the-provider): Verify the consumer pact with the Provider API
- [step 5: **fix consumer**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step5#step-5---back-to-the-client-we-go): Fix the consumer's bad assumptions about the Provider
- [step 6: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step6#step-6---consumer-updates-contract-for-missing-products): Write a pact test for `404` (missing User) in consumer
- [step 7: **provider states**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step7#step-7---adding-the-missing-states): Update API to handle `404` case
- [step 8: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step8#step-8---authorization): Write a pact test for the `401` case
- [step 9: **pact test**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step9#step-9---implement-authorisation-on-the-provider): Update API to handle `401` case
- [step 10: **request filters**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step10#step-10---request-filters-on-the-provider): Fix the provider to support the `401` case
- [step 11: **pact broker**](https://github.com/bookmd/pact-workshop-js/tree/step11#step-11---using-a-pact-broker): Implement a broker workflow for integration with CI/CD

_NOTE: Each step is tied to, and must be run within, a git branch, allowing you to progress through each stage incrementally. For example, to move to step 2 run the following: `git checkout step2`_

## Learning objectives

If running this as a team workshop format, you may want to take a look through the [learning objectives](./LEARNING.md).

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.docker.com)

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

[Node + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Scenario

There are two components in scope for our workshop.

1. Product Catalog website. It provides an interface to query the Product service for product information.
1. Product Service (Provider). Provides useful things about products, such as listing all products and getting the details of an individual product.

## Step 7 - Adding the missing states

Our code already deals with missing users and sends a `404` response, however our test data fixture always has product ID 10 and 11 in our database.

In this step, we will add a state handler (`stateHandlers`) to our provider Pact verifications, which will update the state of our data store depending on which states the consumers require.

States are invoked prior to the actual test function is invoked. You can see the full [lifecycle here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go#lifecycle-of-a-provider-verification).

We're going to add handlers for all our states:

- products exist
- no products exist
- product with ID 10 exists
- product with ID 11 does not exist

Let's open up our provider Pact verifications in `provider/product/product.pact.test.js`:

```javascript
// add this to the Verifier opts
stateHandlers: {
  "product with ID 10 exists": () => {
    controller.repository.products = new Map([
      ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1")]
    ]);
  },
  "products exist": () => {
    controller.repository.products = new Map([
      ["09", new Product("09", "CREDIT_CARD", "Gem Visa", "v1")],
      ["10", new Product("10", "CREDIT_CARD", "28 Degrees", "v1")]
    ]);
  },
  "no products exist": () => {
    controller.repository.products = new Map();
  },
  "product with ID 11 does not exist": () => {
    controller.repository.products = new Map();
  },
}
```

Let's see how we go now:

```console
❯ npm run test:pact --prefix provider

Verifying a pact between FrontendWebsite and ProductService

  get all products
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers
        "Content-Type" with value "application/json; charset=utf-8" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)

  get product with ID 10
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers
        "Content-Type" with value "application/json; charset=utf-8" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)

  get product with ID 11
    returns a response which
      has status code 404 (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)

  get all products
    returns a response which
      has status code 200 (OK)
      includes headers
        "Content-Type" with value "application/json; charset=utf-8" (OK)
      has a matching body (OK)
```

_NOTE_: The states are not necessarily a 1 to 1 mapping with the consumer contract tests. You can reuse states amongst different tests. In this scenario we could have used `no products exist` for both tests which would have equally been valid.
